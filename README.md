## Task description

Build a new Vue-Component 'AttributeBadge.vue'.

Look at layout-blue.png, layout-red.png, layout-number.png
how the component should look like or look here to see the component in action:

https://widget.vergleich.org/comparison/?comparisonId=26


The Attribute Badge component should get three values as Vue-Properties.

- type (type of rating in the badge, text or number)
- rating (rating between 1 (bad) and 100 (very good))
- color (the color of the badge, see layouts)

the rating value should converted in the new component to german school grades!

rating       school grades
100 - 90     1 = sehr gut
 89 - 70     2 = gut
 69 - 50     3 = befriedigend
 49 - 30     4 = ausreichend
 29 - 20     5 = mangelhaft
  19 - 1     6 = ungen√ºgend

translations: 
1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = satisfactory, 4 = sufficient, 5 = poor, 6 = deficient
